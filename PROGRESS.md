# PolySignal-OS — Current System State

## System Overview

PolySignal-OS is an AI-native prediction market intelligence system. It scans Polymarket via the Gamma API, detects signals through a 7-node MasterLoop (LangGraph), publishes to MoltBook, and writes cycle learnings to memory. Deployed on NVIDIA DGX Spark (Munich), frontend on Vercel.

**Pipeline (complete, risk-gated, publishing, learning):**
```
Polymarket → PERCEPTION → PREDICTION → DRAFT → REVIEW → RISK_GATE → COMMIT → MoltBook → Memory
```

**Three-agent workflow:**
- **Claude Code** — architect, strategy, complex implementations, testing
- **Loop** (OpenClaw sandbox / Telegram) — autonomous developer, code reviews, DGX-local tasks
- **Antigravity** (IDE agent) — DGX ops, Docker rebuilds, file syncing (cheaper per prompt)
- **KWW** — Vault authorizer, human-only tasks, strategic decisions

## MasterLoop Graph (7 nodes + inline publish + learn)

```
perception → prediction → draft → review → risk_gate → [approved] → wait_approval → commit → END
                                              ↓                            │
                                        [RISK_BLOCKED] → END              ├── MoltBook publish (inline)
                                                                          └── write_memory() (inline)

## Honest Architecture Assessment

| Component | What It Does | What It Should Do | Gap |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Perception** | Scans Polymarket Gamma API, detects 5pp moves | Same + multi-source | Minimal |
| **Prediction** | `if avg_move > 0.01 → bullish` | ML model (XGBoost → transformer) | **Critical** |
| **Draft** | Ollama LLM generates shell command from signal | Same | OK |
| **Review** | HMAC audit + supervisor approval | Same | OK |
| **Risk Gate** | $10 max, 75% confidence, $50 daily cap | Same | OK |
| **Wait Approval** | `human_approved = True` (hardcoded) | Telegram YES/NO buttons | **Stub** |
| **Commit** | Execute via OpenClaw sandbox | Same | OK |
| **Publish** | MoltBook dry-run (no JWT yet) | Live posts | Human blocker (JWT) |
| **Learn** | write_memory() + outcome_tracker → labeled data | Feedback loop with accuracy tracking | OK |
| **Scheduler** | `polysignal-scanner.service` (5min, active hours) | Same | OK |

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: CLOSE THE LOOP (Session 9) — COMPLETE
- [x] MoltBook publisher wired into commit_node
- [x] write_memory() wired into commit_node (learning loop)
- [x] Dead files deleted (-1,230 lines)
- [x] MoltBook implementations reconciled
- [x] risk_integration.py promoted to core/
- [x] 140/140 tests

### Phase 1.5: DATA PIPELINE (Session 10) — COMPLETE
- [x] Continuous scanner deployed (Antigravity — systemd service, 5min interval)
- [x] Outcome tracker built (Claude Code — record, evaluate, accuracy summary)
- [x] Outcome tracking wired into MasterLoop (perception evaluates, prediction records, memory includes accuracy)
- [x] Sanitize tests ported (23 tests for MoltBook post sanitizer)
- [x] 190/190 tests

### Phase 2: REAL PREDICTION (next — waiting on 48-72h scanner data)
Replace rule-based predictor with ML. The DGX has a Blackwell GPU sitting idle.
- [ ] Feature engineering from observations table (price, volume, delta, time_horizon)
- [ ] XGBoost baseline model (interpretable, fast to train)
- [ ] Backtest against historical observations
- [ ] A/B: rule-based vs XGBoost confidence scores
- [ ] Promote if XGBoost beats baseline by >10% accuracy

### Phase 3: CONTINUOUS SCANNING — COMPLETE (Antigravity, Session 10)
- [x] `polysignal-scanner.service` deployed on DGX (systemd)
- [x] 5-minute interval, active hours 07:00-01:00 CET
- [x] Graceful SIGTERM, crash isolation per cycle
- [x] Git auto-sync cron installed on DGX

### Phase 4: REAL HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP
Replace auto-approve placeholder with actual Telegram approval.
- [ ] Telegram inline keyboard (YES / NO / SKIP) in wait_approval_node
- [ ] Timeout: auto-reject after 30 minutes
- [ ] Approval audit trail in DB

## Revenue Readiness

| Capability | Status | Blocker |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Polymarket scanning | LIVE | — |
| Signal detection (typed) | LIVE | — |
| Risk gate | WIRED | Kill switch OFF (intentional) |
| HMAC audit | LIVE | — |
| Sandboxed execution | LIVE | — |
| Telegram alerts | LIVE | — |
| MoltBook broadcast | WIRED (dry-run) | Human: Twitter verification → JWT |
| Learning loop | WIRED | memory.md grows per cycle |
| Polymarket wallet | NOT STARTED | Needs wallet + CLOB auth |
| Custom domain | BLOCKED | Human: DNS CNAME + Vercel |

**To go live (human-only steps):**
1. MoltBook registration: Twitter verify → JWT → env var `MOLTBOOK_JWT`
2. DNS: CNAME `polysignal.app` → `cname.vercel-dns.com` + Vercel dashboard
3. Polymarket wallet setup (after MoltBook is active)
4. `TRADING_ENABLED=true` (only after wallet exists)

## Hard Rules

- `core/` is the Vault — read-only without explicit human authorization
- `lab/` is the scratchpad — build here, test, request promotion
- `workflows/` is editable with justification (not Vault)
- Docker config changes need container **destruction**, not restart
- Never re-add `"api": "anthropic-messages"` to `openclaw.json`
- `loop-telegram` service removed (Session 9) — OpenClaw owns Telegram now
- No `TRADING_ENABLED=true` until Polymarket wallet exists
- No credentials in markdown files or chat history
