## 2026-03-26 MacBook Session 31 Summary

**Done:**
- Fixed scanner dead 29h (Restart=always in systemd)
- Expanded predictions from 2 to 13/cycle via price-level bias, near-decided filter, lower observation thresholds
- Fixed staleness detection blocking diverse predictions (current-batch diversity check)
- Resurrected Loop: switched model Nemotron-3-Super (86GB, unloaded) to llama3.3:70b (42GB), gateway running, Telegram online
- Verified Cloudflare SSH works (was transient issue)
- 6 new tests for price-level bias (438/438 total)
- 3 commits pushed: 39ed76e, 6fb4357, 4efcbd8

**State:**
- Scanner: running, Restart=always, 13 predictions/cycle, 10 paper trades, 0 errors
- Loop: gateway running on llama3.3:70b, Telegram @OpenClawOnDGX_bot connected, first heartbeat pending
- DGX: 41C, 4W idle, 4GB RAM (spikes to ~46GB when llama3.3:70b loads)
- Tests: 438/438 passing
- Meta-gate: 59% (138W/97L) -- passing
- Accuracy: 50.7% overall (208C/202I/172N out of 827 evaluated)
- Cloudflare: SSH works, HTTP origin needs dashboard fix (.244 -> localhost:3000)

**Next:**
- Monitor per-category prediction accuracy (politics/sports/crypto)
- Check Loop's first heartbeat quality on llama3.3:70b
- Update Claude Code to v2.1.84 for 1M context window
- Wire whale signals into predictions
- First live trade + Telegram approval gate

**Watch out:**
- llama3.3:70b quality is untested for Loop heartbeats -- may produce worse output than Nemotron
- 87% of Polymarket markets are essentially decided (<5% or >95%) -- near-decided filter handles this but monitor
- Staleness detection has two paths now (history-based + current-batch diversity) -- edge cases possible
- Scanner Restart=always means it restarts even on intentional stops -- use `systemctl --user stop` explicitly

**Codebase health:** Stable. 438 tests, clean pipeline, no dead code introduced. Price-level bias is clean addition to existing hierarchy (outcome > observation > price-level).
